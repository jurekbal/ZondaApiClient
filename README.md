# ZondaApiClient
Simple Client for Zonda exchange API

Early development stage

There is working code to get public and secured API. Run test class with Your favorite IDE.

First milestone target is to get history of transactions and save essential data as CSV file. History data served by Zonda webservice had reduced precision of price and volume and was useless (not sure if they have fixed it already).
